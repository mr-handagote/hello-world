# hello-world
My first attempt at creating a repository

I'm learning how to code so I can become a front-end web developer with focus on User Experience and Interaction design.
I also want to learn how to visualise data sets using programming to create iterations in a physical space, i.e. sculpture, graphic art and sound.
